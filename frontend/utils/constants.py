Application constants.

This module defines colour palettes, pollutant thresholds, meteorological thresholds,
component weights aligned with the backend risk algorithm, descriptive information
for pollutants and weather factors, risk level descriptions and recommendations,
and various other configuration values used throughout the frontend.
